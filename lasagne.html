            <li>Dry red or white wine</li>
            <li>2 bayleaves</li>
            <li>A few thyme sprigs</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1200g canned cherry tomatoes (peeled or chopped)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Cheese (Optional: Cheddar, Tasty, Parmesan, Peccorino, Mozzarella)</li>
            <li>Beef or pork mince (Optional: substitute additional onions, carrots and celary)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Making the Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pan over a medium heat. I prefer to use a dutch oven for this.</li>
            <li>Add onion and sauté for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Add carrot and celery and continue to sauté for another minute. Add mince here if you choose.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and continue to cook until garlic is cooked, roughly 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to low and add a splash of wine, scrape anything off the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add tomatos to the pan.</li>
            <li>Tie up bayleaves and thyme with kitchen twine and put into the sauce.
                <li>If you do not have kitchen twine that is okay! Just put the bayleaves in the pot and add the thyme leaves only to the pot.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Cook for as long as possible with the lid on, up to 4 hours, stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>Take out bayleaves.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembling the Lasagne</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly grease the outside of the lasagne tray.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of sauce into the tray, just enough to cover the bottom layer.</li>
            <li>Lay a layer of pasta sheets, then a layer of sauce. You can also add cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat step three until you are out of pasta sheets or sauce. Remember to finish with a layer of sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the cheese.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking the Lasagne</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bake for about 40 minutes or until the cheese is starting to turn golden.</li>
            <li>Take lasagne out of the oven and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve!</li>
        </ol>
